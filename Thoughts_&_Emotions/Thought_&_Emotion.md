# __Design for Thought and Emotion__

[__Aristotelian reasoning__](Glossary.ipynb#aristotelian-reasoning) is a classical form of logical thinking developed by Aristotle that explains how we move from general principles to specific conclusions using structured logic.

Aristotelian reasoning is [__deductive reasoning__](Glossary.ipynb#deductive-reasoning)based on __syllogisms__—formal arguments where a conclusion necessarily follows from two premises.


While conscious [__Aristotelian reasoning__](Glossary.ipynb#aristotelian-reasoning)  This content is hidden by default reasoning is the most apparent aspect of our thought process, subconscious thought has a vital role to play.

## __`The Nature of Experience`__
---

All threads happen at the same time, but you can analyze them separately.

### __Four threads of experience__

* __`Sensual`:__ What a person perceives through the senses.

  `sight`, `sound`, `touch`, `movement`, `texture`

  `colors`, `animations`, `haptic feedback`, `sound cues`
<br>

* __`Emotional:`__ feelings, relationships

  `frustration`, `delight`, `anxiety`, `confidence`, `boredom`

<br>

* __Compositional:__ How the experience is structured and understood. How pieces fit together over time

  `coherence`, `flow`, `clarity`, `rules`, e`xpectations`, `cause & effect`
    
<br>

* __Spatio-temporal:__ How the experience unfolds in space and time. sense of time and location.

  `pace`, `duration`, `timing`, `context`

    where and when interactions happen

<br>

### __Six processes of sense-making__

* __Anticipating:__ what is going to happen

* __Connecting:__ pre-cognitive sensation (perhaps a sense of tension or the thrill of novelty)

* __Interpreting:__ complex emotions

* __Reflecting:__ looking back

* __Appropriating:__ interweaving into life

  __makes our experiences our own by relating them to our own values and history.__

* __Recounting:__ telling others

<br>

## __`Transforming Emotional Experience`__
___

> ## __"We need to be able to maintain the emotional experiences that come with the physical world."__

<br>

__`Dynamism`__
the capacity for continuous or responsive change in behavior, state, or structure over time.

## __`Design for Peak Experience`__
___

__`Peak experience`__ highlights the importance of designing specifically for a target audience as opposed to the general user.

__Distinguishes between designs that are acceptable versus loved.__

<br>

## __`Extended Episodic Experience`__
___

__`Extended episodic experience (EEE)`__ A concept in HCI/UX that describes a user experience that unfolds over multiple episodes across time, rather than in a single, isolated interaction.

> ### __"It’s the whole journey, not just one moment."__

## Our experiences are in effect threaded along a number of dimensions. They may be interpersonal, our repeated experiences with particular individuals or groups. Or they may be spatio-temporal and therefore connected to particular times or places.

__`Temporal threads`__related events that occur over time.

__Key characteristics__

* Spans time: days, weeks, months, or longer

* Made of episodes: each interaction is a distinct moment (an “episode”)

* Cumulative meaning: earlier experiences shape expectations, emotions, and behavior in later ones

* Memory-dependent: users remember past interactions and factor them into future decisions

<br>

__Designing for EEE means considering:__

* Onboarding and long-term engagement

* Trust building over time

* How errors, delight, or frustration accumulate

* Consistency across touchpoints

<br>

__Customer retention strategies for e-commerce:__

* Use customer accounts

* Improve your customer support

* Start a customer loyalty program

* Send engaging emails to customers

* Offer a discount or credit to return

* Collect customer feedback

* Perfect the returns process

* Offer a subscription service

* Turn unhappy customer complaints into resolutions


__`Gamification`__ the use of game design elements in non-game contexts.

## __Theory of Extended Episodic Experience__
___

### Make it easier for users to feel informed and in control

### Ensure that information about past events is readily available 

### Ensure users know the current state of affairs

### Ensure users have some control over how events will proceed.
