Great choice—that book is *very* portfolio-worthy, especially for HCI. Here are **strong, concrete ways** to incorporate *Technology as Experience* (McCarthy & Wright) so it actually signals insight, not just “I read a theory book.”

## 1. Best Option: **Applied Theory Blog Post** (⭐ most impressive)

**Title ideas**

* *Designing for Enchantment: What McCarthy & Wright Teach Us About Emotional UX*
* *Beyond Usability: Enchantment as an HCI Design Goal*
* *Technology as Experience: Designing Interfaces People Care About*

**What this article does**
You:

* briefly explain **enchantment** (not academically dense)
* show how it **changes design decisions**
* apply it to **real systems or your own projects**

**Suggested structure**

1. **Hook (personal + concrete)**

   * A moment when a product felt “magical” or emotionally meaningful
2. **Key idea from the book**

   * Technology as lived experience, not just tool use
   * Enchantment = curiosity, emotional resonance, aesthetic pleasure
3. **Why usability alone is insufficient**

   * Efficient ≠ meaningful
4. **Applied examples**

   * Spotify Wrapped
   * Duolingo streaks
   * Apple onboarding animations
5. **Design takeaways**

   * Design for anticipation, reflection, and emotional payoff
6. **How this informs your work**

   * How you’d design differently in future projects

**Why this works**
It shows you can **translate theory → design thinking**, which is exactly what HCI-heavy teams look for.

## 2. Alternative: **Critical Reading / Design Reflection**

More academic, still strong.

**Title ideas**

* *Technology as Experience: A Critical Reflection for Designers*
* *From Function to Feeling: Reflections on McCarthy & Wright*

**Angle**
Instead of summarizing, you:

* critique the framework
* ask where it works / doesn’t
* reflect as a designer, not a student

**Focus on**

* strengths of “enchantment” as a design goal
* limits (e.g. dark patterns, manipulation, novelty fatigue)
* tension between enchantment and accessibility

This works well if your portfolio already leans **research + theory**.

## 3. Case Study Style: **Enchantment Audit**

Very portfolio-friendly and practical.

**Title ideas**

* *An Enchantment Audit of Duolingo (or Spotify, Airbnb, etc.)*
* *Where Enchantment Appears—and Fails—in Modern UX*

**How it works**
Pick one product and analyze it through McCarthy & Wright’s lens:

* moments of enchantment
* moments of friction
* emotional trajectory across time (EEE tie-in 👀)

This pairs beautifully with:

* interaction design
* service design
* product thinking roles

## 4. Short Concept Piece (If You Want Brevity)

If you don’t want a long article.

**Title**

* *What Does “Enchantment” Mean in UX Design?*

800–1,000 words:

* define the concept
* give 2–3 examples
* end with design implications

Great as a **card at the bottom of your UX/HCI page**.

---

## Where to Place It in Your Portfolio

Based on your earlier questions:

* ✔️ Put it on the **UX / HCI / Product Design page**
* ✔️ Use **article cards**, not just a button
* ✔️ Label clearly: *Theory → Practice*

Example card label:

> **Design Theory**
> *Designing for Enchantment in HCI (McCarthy & Wright)*

## What This Signals to Recruiters

This tells them:

* you understand **experience beyond screens**
* you can reason about **emotion, meaning, and time**
* you’re not just implementing patterns—you’re **thinking critically**

If you want, tell me:

* which product you’d like to analyze
* whether this is for **UX, full-stack, or research-leaning roles**

I can help you outline the exact article you should write—or draft the opening paragraph.
